# ReactiveCocoa for Parse

[Parse](http://parse.com) is advertised as a service that allows developers to
build connected apps without needing to build your own backend. Parse is
supposed to make it easy to add a backend while keeping your focus on building
the front end.

[ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa), you've heard
about it, now try it out. This library might be the perfect starting place for
you to get started on that app you've been wanting to build, using Parse, while
using ReactiveCocoa, that library you've been itching to try.

Currently supports iOS, but I just got started. OS X next.

Pull requests welcome!
