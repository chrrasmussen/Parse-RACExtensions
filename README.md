# ReactiveCocoa for Parse

[Parse](http://parse.com) is a service that allows developers to build server
backed mobile apps, without needing to build a custom backend. Parse makes it
easy to throw in a data backend, freeing you to focus on building the front
end.

[ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa), you've heard
about it, now try it out. This library might be the perfect starting place to
get started on that app you've been wanting to build, using Parse, while using
ReactiveCocoa, that library you've been itching to try.

Currently supports iOS, but I just got started. OS X next.

Pull requests welcome!
